## Requirements

React's `createPortal` API allows you to render elements outside of their parent componentâ€™s DOM hierarchy. This is especially useful when dealing with UI elements like modals, tooltips, dropdowns, and overlays that must break out of the normal rendering flow.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

To use `createPortal`, make sure your project meets these requirements:

- React 16 or higher
- `react-dom` installed
- An additional DOM node (e.g. a `div#modal-root`) defined in your base HTML

Install React and ReactDOM if you haven't already:

```package-install
npm install react react-dom
```
