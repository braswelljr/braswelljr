# Tab Animation with Framer Motion

Tabs are a common UI element that can be used to switch between different views. In this post, we will create a simple tab animation with framer-motion.

## Setup

We will use next.js to create a new project. You can follow the [next.js getting started guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) to create a new project.

```bash
npm install framer-motion
````
