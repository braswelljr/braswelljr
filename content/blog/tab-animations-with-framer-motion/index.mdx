# Tab Animation with Framer Motion

Tabs are a common UI element that can be used to switch between different views. In this post, we will create a simple tab animation with framer-motion.

## Requirements

This post assumes that you have a basic understanding of React. If you are new to React, you can follow the [React getting started guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html). We will also use [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling and [framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) a popular animation library for React.

## Setup

We will use next.js to create a new project. You can follow the [next.js getting started guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) to create a new project.

```bash
yarn add framer-motion tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
````
