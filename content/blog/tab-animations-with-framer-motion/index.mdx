# Tab Animation with Framer Motion

Tabs are a common UI element that can be used to switch between different views. In this post, we will create a simple tab animation with framer-motion.

## Requirements

This post assumes that you have a basic understanding of React. If you are new to React, you can follow the [React getting started guide](https://react.dev/). We will also use [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling and [framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) a popular animation library for React.

## Setup

We will install the required dependencies for the project.

```bash
yarn add framer-motion tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

## Creating the Tabs

We will create a simple array or objects that will hold the tab data.

```tsx
export const tabs = [
  { id: 1, title: 'tab 1', content: 'tab 1 content' },
  { id: 2, title: 'tab 2', content: 'tab 2 content' },
  { id: 3, title: 'tab 3', content: 'tab 3 content' }
]
```
