The **HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)** is the foundation of data communication on the web. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and how web servers and browsers should respond to various commands.

## HTTP/1.1

**Released**: 1997
**Key Features**:

- Text-based protocol
- One TCP connection per request
- Head-of-line blocking
- Supports caching, persistent connections (keep-alive), and chunked transfer

### Example Request

```http
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```

## HTTP/2

**Released**: 2015
Built On: TCP
Key Improvements:

- Binary framing layer
- Multiplexing (multiple requests in a single TCP connection)
- Header compression (HPACK)
- Server push (proactively sending resources)

### Benefits Over HTTP/1.1

- Reduced latency.
- Better use of a single TCP connection.
- Fewer round trips.

## HTTP/3

**Released**: 2022
Built On: QUIC (UDP-based)
Key Features:

- Fully multiplexed using QUIC streams.
- Connection migration (better for mobile).
- TLS 1.3 integrated by default.
- Eliminates head-of-line blocking at the transport layer.

### Why It Matters

HTTP/3 addresses long-standing issues from TCP-based protocols. It's designed to be faster and more reliable—especially on unreliable or mobile networks.

| Feature              | HTTP/1.1 | HTTP/2 | HTTP/3      |
| -------------------- | -------- | ------ | ----------- |
| Protocol Layer       | TCP      | TCP    | QUIC (UDP)  |
| Multiplexing         | ❌       | ✔️     | ✔️          |
| Header Compression   | ❌       | HPACK  | QPACK       |
| Server Push          | ❌       | ✔️     | ✔️(limited) |
| Connection Migration | ❌       | ❌     | ✔️(limited) |

<Callout type="info">
  HTTP/3 is already supported by major platforms like Google, Facebook, and Cloudflare. It's becoming the new default
  for high-performance web communication.
