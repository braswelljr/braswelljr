## Requirements

A simple layout animation with framer motion and react. Animating the active card in a grid of cards can help the user to focus on the content of the card. This is a simple example of how to do it.

This post assumes that you have a basic understanding of React. If you are new to React, you can follow the [React getting started guide](https://react.dev/). We will also use [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling and [motion/react](https://www.framer.com/motion/) a popular animation library for React.

## Setup

### Dependencies Installation

We will install the required dependencies for the project.

```package-install
motion/react tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer clsx
```

### Styling the Grid Card

We will use tailwindcss to style the tabs. We will create a new file `tailwind.config.js` in the root of the project and add the following code.

```js title="tailwind.config.js"
module.exports = {
  experimental: {
    optimizeUniversalDefaults: true
  },
  content: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,vue,mdx,md}'],
  darkMode: 'class',
  theme: {
    extend: {}
  },
  plugins: []
};
```

We will also create a new file `postcss.config.js` in the root of the project and add the following code.

```js title="postcss.config.js"
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    'tailwindcss/nesting': {}, // enable css nesting
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {}
  }
};
```

We will also update the `tailwind.css` file in the `styles` folder with the following code.

```css title="styles/tailwind.css"
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

## Creating the Component

We will create a new file `animated-grid.tsx` in the `components` folder and add the following code.

<include cwd meta='title="components/animated-grid.tsx"'>
  ./src/components/snippets/grid-component/animated-grid.tsx
</include>
## Conclusion

We have successfully created a grid with a selected item animation. You can use this animation to create a grid of products, images, or any other content. You can also use this animation to create a grid of cards with a selected item animation.

<AnimatedGridComponent />
